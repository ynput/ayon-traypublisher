    Plugin create representations for simple instances based

    There is also possibility to have reviewable representation which can be
    stored under 'reviewable' attribute stored on instance data. If there was
    already created representation with the same files as 'reviewable' contains

    Representations can be marked for review and in that case is also added
    'review' family to instance families. For review can be marked only one
    representation so **first** representation that has extension available
    in '_review_extensions' is used for review.

    For instance 'source' is used path from last representation created
    from 'representation_files'.
